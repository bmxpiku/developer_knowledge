# Abstraction vs Hermetization

| Abstraction                                                    | Hermetization                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Solves problems on design level                                | Solves problems upon implementation                                                               |
| Serves to hide unneeded info, focused on important things      | Hides code and data in one unit, protecting them from external world                              |
| Focused on what object does, not how                           | Hides details and mechanisms responsible for how object does things                               |
| Is a wider point of view on object upon design                 | Hides implementation details responsible for actions                                              |
| Example:                                                       | Example:                                                                                          |
| Look at old phone, you see screen and buttons to select number | Inside details of phone implementation are: how screen work, how buttons work, how its connected. |
