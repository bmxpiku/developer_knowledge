## New features in ES2020

- Promise.allSettled()

It includes an array of objects that describe the outcome of each promise (whether they were resolved or rejected), as well as the values.

- Optional chaining

An operator `?.` that allows you to read properties within nested objects (objects proper, arrays, functions) without checking the validity of objects in the chain.

- BigInt

This is a new primitive that can represent arbitrary large numbers greater than 2^53, which is the max safe integer for a Number primitive that JavaScript can work with

- Nullish coalescing operator

`??` - when null or undefined - as a special case for logical OR `||` which was checking left side for falsy

- String.matchAll()

- Dynamic imports
```javascript
import('../../config.json').then(module => {
  // do something with module
})
```
