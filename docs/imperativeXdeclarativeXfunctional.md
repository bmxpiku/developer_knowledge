## Imperative
1. how to achieve our goal
2. means any style of programming where your program is structured out of instructions describing 
how the operations performed by a computer will happen.
3. step by step recipe

C, C++, Java, Javascript, BASIC, Python, Ruby, and most other programming languages are imperative.
As a rule, if it has explicit loops (for, while, repeat) 
that change variables with explicit assignment operations at each loop, then it's imperative.

## Declarative

1. what we want to achieve
2. means any style of programming where your program is a description either of the problem or 
the solution - but doesn't explicitly state how the work will be done.
3. this is what i want, now you work out how to do it

SQL and XSLT are two well-known examples of declarative programming. 
Markup languages such as HTML and CSS are 
declarative too, although they are usually not powerful enough to describe arbitrary algorithms.

## Functional

is programming by evaluating functions and functions of functions... 
As (strictly defined) functional programming means programming 
by defining side-effect free mathematical functions so it is a 
form of declarative programming but it isn't the only kind of declarative programming.
